### About me

I'm a Data Scientist & Researcher where Psychology meets AI üß†üíª

> "In data we trust... but we double-check our p-values just in case"

My career has evolved from research and methodology into data science and AI. My journey began with a deep interest in conducting the best psychological research possible‚Äîdriven by a desire to better understand human behavioral patterns, and make a positive impact on the world, and in particular in the educational field. As I delved into research methodology,  I became increasingly interested in the different approaches to extracting insights from data.

This curiosity led me from traditional statistical methods to programming, automation, and eventually, machine learning and AI. Over time, my focus expanded beyond psychology to data science, where I now integrate research methods with advanced analytical techniques to solve complex problems and generate meaningful insights.

### üîç What i do

I apply my background in psychology and research to:

  - Research methodology and data analysis
  - Machine learning and AI applications
  - Understanding human behavior through data-driven insights

### üìä Experience in:
  - Research methodology and statistical analysis
  - Data science and machine learning
  - Large Language Models (LLMs) and NLP
  - AI-driven insights and predictive modeling
  - Data visualization and storytelling

### üíª Projects & Interests:
  - Exploring the intersection of psychology and AI
  - Applying machine learning to behavioral data
  - Experimenting with LLMs for research and automation
  - Developing tools that enhance decision-making through data
    
### üìö Formation:

   - Master's Degree in Educational Psychology
   - Master's Degree in Methodology of Behavioral and Health Sciences
   - Generative AI Bootcamp

### üéÆ Outside of Work:
When I'm not working with data and AI, I enjoy unwinding with video games, strategy board games, and technology. I'm always curious about the psychology behind game design and user experience, whether it's analyzing player behavior or appreciating well-crafted narratives. I also enjoy reading, coffee, and discovering new music.
